/**
 * Hystrix and Spring Cloud use the @HystrixCommand annotation to mark Java class methods as being managed by a
 * Hystrix circuit breaker. When the Spring framework sees the @HystrixCommand, it will dynamically generate a
 * proxy that will wrapper the method and manage all calls to that method through a thread pool of threads specifically
 * set aside to handle remote calls
 * Hystrix will also monitor the number of times a call fails and if enough calls fail, Hystrix will automatically
 * prevent future calls from reaching the service by failing the call before the requests ever hit the remote resource
 */

/**
 * Without using a bulkhead pattern, the default behavior for microservice calls is that the calls are executed using the same
 * threads that are reserved for handling requests for the entire Java container. In high volumes,
 * performance problems with one service out of many can result in all of the threads for the Java container
 * being maxed out and waiting to process work, while new requests for work back up. The Java container will eventually crash
 * The problem is if you have services that have far higher volumes or longer completion times then other services,
 * you can end up introducing thread exhaustion into your Hystrix thread pools because one service ends up dominating
 * all of the threads in the default thread pool

    // The execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds is used to set the length of the timeout (in milliseconds) of the circuit breaker

    // circuitBreaker.sleepWindowInMilliseconds, is the amount of time Hystrix will sleep once the circuit breaker is tripped before Hystrix will allow another call through to see if the service is healthy again
    // metrics.rollingStats.timeInMilliseconds, is used to control the size of the window that will be used by Hystrix to monitor for problems with a ser- vice call. The default value for this is 10,000 milliseconds
